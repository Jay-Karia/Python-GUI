Mayank Agarwal's fight to reclaim his place in Indian Test eleven starts on Tuesday when he walks out to open in a three-day game against 'County Select XI', starting in Durham tomorrow as best friend KL Rahul gears up to keep wickets in Rishabh Pant's absence. The match has been accorded first-class status, a first for India in many years since Mahendra Singh Dhoni took over captain. The Jharkhand dasher believed that an "official match" robbed all players from getting some game time. However, the team management wanted a proper first-class game to get into the groove before the start of the Test series next month.According to BCCI sources, Pant, who had tested positive for COVID-19, has completed his stipulated 10-day isolation in an acquaintance's place in London and is "recovering well" but he is yet to join the team bubble in Durham.

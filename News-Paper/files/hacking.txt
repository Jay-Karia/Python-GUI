Cyber attacks in India are getting deadlier year after year. Each strike has taken proportions to drive home the fact that no one is safe. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced companies to come up with work from home which has made things more vulnerable and lack of good infrastructure adds more woes to make it worse.The recent cyberattacks on big firms like Domino’s India, Air India, and others show a clear example that we are heading towards a big crisis. Domino’s India became a victim of a major data leak as more than 18 crore orders’ data has been put up on the dark web for sale as a searchable database. On May 21, the data of more than 45 lakh users of global airlines including Air India were compromised. This includes personal data such as credit card details and passport information. Other companies like MobiKwik, Airtel, etc were also affected.
